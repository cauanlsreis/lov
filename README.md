# Playful Love Website

This project is a playful and romantic website designed to engage users with a fun interaction. The main feature is a question directed at "Biatriz" with two response options: "Yes" and "No". 

## Features

- **Interactive Question**: The website displays the phrase "Biatriz você me ama?" with two buttons for user interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is styled with a pink and red color palette, creating a vibrant and romantic atmosphere.
- **Button Functionality**:
  - The "Yes" button redirects users to a page with a romantic love text.
  - The "No" button evades the mouse cursor and shows an alert with the message "Opção Inválida" when clicked on a smartphone.
